1. introduction to Code Reviews:

code reviews involve inspecting code changes made by one team member before they are merged into the main codebase. This process allows for identifying bugs, improving code quality, and ensuring consistency across the codebase. Code reviews also facilitate knowledge sharing among team members and provide an opportunity for mentorship and learning.

2. guidelines for Effective Code Reviews:
Set Clear Objectives: Clearly define the goals of the code review, whether it's to ensure functionality, maintainability, or adherence to coding standards

Regular Reviews: Incorporate code reviews as a regular part of the development process, ideally before merging code into the main branch.

Provide Constructive Feedback: Offer specific and actionable feedback, focusing on improving the code rather than criticizing the developer.


3. Common Pitfalls to Avoid  :
Nitpicking: Avoid overly nitpicking minor style issues that don't significantly impact code quality or functionality.
Lack of Ownership: Ensure that both the author and reviewer take ownership of the code changes and follow through on addressing feedback.
Ignoring Feedback: don't dismiss feedback without consideration; take the time to understand and address reviewer comments.
Rushing Through Reviews: Avoid rushing through code reviews to meet deadlines, as this can lead to missed defects and lower-quality code.
