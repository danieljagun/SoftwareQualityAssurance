# Effective Sprint Planning and Retrospectives

### <ins> What is Sprint Planning?</ins>

Sprint Planning is a crucial event in Scrum that kicks off the sprint. Its main objectives are to define what the sprint will deliver and outline how the team will achieve these deliverables. This event hinges on three essential components: setting a sprint goal, understanding the teamâ€™s capacity, and prioritizing backlog items. Effective sprint planning aligns the team's efforts, sets clear expectations, and lays the foundations for a successful sprint by focusing on what's most important and achievable.

### <ins> What is a Sprint Retrospective?</ins>

The Sprint Retrospective concludes each sprint, offering the team an opportunity to reflect on the sprint that has just ended. The aim of the retrospective is to highlight what worked well and identify challenges faced, encouraging a culture of continuous improvement. By discussing these aspects, the team pinpoints areas for improvement and agrees on actionable steps to enhance future sprints.
